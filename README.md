# Dijkstra_Algorithm_Optimization
This repository contains an optimized implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a graph, along with a normal, non-optimized implementation for comparison. The goal is to showcase how optimizing algorithms can significantly improve their time and space complexity.
